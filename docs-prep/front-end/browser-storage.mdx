# Browser Storage

## IndexDB

IndexDB is ideal for handling large datasets and offline web applications, offering advanced querying and long-term persistence.

```javascript
const request = window.indexedDB.open("dbName", version);

const transaction = db.transaction(["objStoreName"], "readwrite");
const objextStore = transaction.objectStore("objStoreName");
const request = objextStore.add({ key: "value" });

request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  // data saved succesfully
};

request.onerror = (event) => {
  // error occured while saving data
};
```

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous API** Doesn't block main thread
- **Key-Value Storage** Fast retrieval and indexing
- **Indexed Queries** Improving search performance
- **Transactions** Blocking and uninterrupted (?)
- **Object Stores** Data can be separated into different object stores
- **Persistence** Long-term, surviving browser restarts and system crashes

### Use Cases

- **Offline Web Applications**
- **Caching**
- **Data-Intensive Applications**

### Advantages Over Others

- **High storage capacity** Megabytes to gigabytes
- **Complex data queries** Advanced queries using indexes, enhancing performance
- **Durability** Data persists on browser close, or system crash
- **Scalability** Scales well with large datasets

## Local Storage

Local Storage is a simple key-value storage option for smaller-scale data with cross-browser compatibility.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 22,
};

localStorage.setItem("profile", person);
console.log(localStorage.getItem("profile"));
```

### Key Features

- **Easy-to-use API** setItem() and getItem()
- **Synchronous Operations** Operates synchronously, blocking the main thread during read and write
- **String-Based Storage** Requiring serialisation and deserialization of objects
- **Limited Storage Capacity** Typically 5-10MB of data storage

### Use Cases

- **User Preferences and Settings** Such as theme or language
- **Form Data Persistence** Prevents data loss in page refresh or browser close
- **Simple Data Caching** Small and frequently accessed data

### Advantages

- **Simplicity** Straightforward API for storing and retrieving data
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** Wide support across modern browsers
- **Persistence** Data persists after browser or system restarts
- **Lightweight** Ideal for small data with no complex querying or indexing

## Session Storage

Session Storage is suitable for temporary data storage during browsing and clearing data when the tab or browser is closed.

```javascript
const person = { name: "John Snow", knows: "nothing" };

sessionStorage.setItem("scores", JSON.stringify(person));

/** Gone as soon as tab is closed */
```

### Key Features

- **Same API as Local Storage**
- **Tab-Specific Storage** (cleared when the tab is closed)
- **Size Limitations** Typically around 5-10MB

### Use Cases

- **Shopping Carts**
- **Multi-Step Forms**
- **Transient Application State** Active tabs or selected options

### Advantages

- **Isolation** Tab-specific storage, enhancing privacy and security
- **Transience** Clears when the user closes the tab or browser, enhancing privacy and security
- **Lightweight** Ideal for small data that does not require long-term persistence
