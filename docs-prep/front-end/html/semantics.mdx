# HTML - Semantics

## Benefits of Semantic HTML

- Accessibility
  - Proper use of HTML semantic tags will allow screen readers to understand content better
- SEO
  - Pages with correctly implemented semantic HTML have an advantage in SEO over those that don’t.

## Semantic Structure

- `<header>`
  - Defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section
- `<nav>`
  - Used for navigation links
  - Can be nested within `<header>` tag
  - Or secondary `<nav>` tags are also used elsewhere on the page
- `<main>`
  - Contains the main content (also called the body) of a page
  - There should be only one tag per page.
- `<article>`
  - Defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on
  - It does not necessarily mean a “blog post” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.
- `<section>`
  - Using `<section>` is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme
  - Differs from an article tag in that it isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else
- `<aside>`
  - Defines content that’s less important
  - Often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information
- `<footer>`
  - Used at bottom of a page
  - Usually includes contact, copyright, and some site navigation

## Semantic Text

The semantic HTML tags for text are HTML tags that—besides the formatting—also convey the semantic function of the text they contain.

- `<h1>` (heading)
  - Top level heading
  - Usually only one H1 per page
- `<h2>` to `<h6>` (subheadings)
  - Subheadings of various levels of importance
  - There can be multiple headings of the same level on a single page
- `<p>` (paragraph)
  - A standalone paragraph of text
- `<a>` (anchor)
  - Used to mark up a hyperlink from one page to another
- `<ol>` (ordered list)
  - A list of items that are displayed in a particular order, starting with ordinal numbers
  - One `<li>` (list item) tag contains a single item in the list
- `<ul>` (unordered list)
  - A list of items that do not need to be displayed in a particular order, starting with bullet points
  - One `<li>` (list item) tag contains a single item of the list
- `<q>` / `<blockquote>`
  - A quotation of the text
  - Use `<blockquote>` for long, multi-line quotations
  - Use `<q>` for shorter, inline quotations
- `<em>` (emphasis)
  - Used for text that should be emphasized
- `<strong>` (strong emphasis)
  - Used for text that should be strongly emphasized
- `<code>`
  - A block of computer code

And many others... `<summary>`, `<time>`, `<address>`, `<video>`, etc. [Check out full list](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp)

Don't Use Semantic HTML Tags for Styling, only use them if the content fits the tags purpose.
