# Overview

Long-Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events (SSE)

# Long-Polling (Hanging GET)

Allows the server to push information to a client whenever the data is available.

1. Client HTTP request and waits for a response
2. Server delays response til an update is available or a timeout occurred
3. When available, the server sends a full response to the client
4. Client then sends a new long-poll request, either immediately or after a pause (latency period)
5. Each request has a timeout, so client has to reconnect periodically after connection is closed

## Advantages

- Easy to implement, good for small-scale projects
- Nearly universally supported

## Disadvantages

- Usually not scalable
- Creates a new connection each time, which can be intensive on the server
- Reliable message ordering can be an issue for multiple requests
- Increased latency as the server needs to wait for a new request

# WebSockets

WebSocket uses HTTP as the initial transport mechanism, but keeps the TCP connection alive after the HTTP response so it can be used for sending messages between client and server.

The client establishes a WebSocket connection through a process known as the WebSocket handshake.
In this way, a two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between a client and a server.

## Use Cases

- real-time polling applications
- chat applications
- media players

## Advantages

- Full-duplex asynchronous messaging
- Better origin-based security model
- Lightweight for both client and server
- Ability to detect a dropped client connection
- Can transmit both binary data and UTF-8

## Disadvantages

- Terminated connections aren't automatically recovered
- Older browsers don't support WebSockets (becoming less relevant)
- WebSockets require more upfront work

# Server-Sent Events (SSEs)

Server-Sent Events (SSE) enables a client to receive updates like text-based event data from a server via HTTP connection.

Client establishes a long-term connection with server, which uses this connection to send data to client.
If the client wants to send data to the server, it would require the use of another technology/protocol to do so.

1. Client requests data from a server using regular HTTP
2. The requested webpage opens a connection to the server
3. The server sends the data to the client whenever thereâ€™s new information available

SSEs are best when we need real-time traffic from the server to the client or if the server is generating data in a loop and will be sending multiple events to the client.

## Use Cases

- updating statuses
- push notifications
- newsletters
- news feeds

## Advantages

- Simple to implement and use for both client and server
- Supported by most browsers
- No trouble with firewalls
- Automatic reconnection, event IDs and the ability to send arbitrary events

## Disadvantages

- Unidirectional nature can be limiting
- Limitation for the maximum number of open connections
  - limit per browser is six (painful for multi tabs)
- Does not support binary data (limited to UTF-8)
- Not extensible if your app needs change
