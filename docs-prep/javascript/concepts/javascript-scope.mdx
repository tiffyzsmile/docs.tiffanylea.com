# Scope


## Q: What will be printed on the console?

```javascript
(function () {
  var a = (b = 5);
})();

console.log(b); // $: 5
```

- variable `a` is declared using the keyword `var` as local function variable
- b is not defined using `var` and is assigned to the global scope
- doesn't use strict mode (`'use strict';`) inside the function
  - strict mode requires you to explicitly reference to the global scope
    - `var a = window.b = 5;`

```javascript
(function () {
  'use strict';
  var a = (b = 5);
})();

console.log(b); // $: Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
```
