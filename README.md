This is a personal quick reference for all things tech and career.

## Problem

There is no possible way to contain such a broad spectrum of knowledge in such detail across all the domains I work within

- languages (js/php/velocity/xml/css/html...)
- version control (github/gitlab)
- front end (performance/accessibility/usability)
- toolset (eslint/prettier/webpack)
- libraries and frameworks (react/vue/angular/lodash)
- device specific (ios/android/web)
- role specific tech (devops/security/backend)
- style guides and api docs (docz/storybook/swagger)
- component libraries (npm/lerna/rollup)
- project management (scrum/agile/jira)
- people management (1.1s/hr/hiring/coaching/conflict resolution)
- UI/UX/Design resources (adobe.../sketch/figma)
- presentations and training (tools/do's and dont's/previously given)
- interview specific knowledge (big o/CS degree stuff)
- and many... many... many more.

## Specfic Pain Points

- Ramping back up on a less visited topic can be time-consuming
  - I only need a 5-min refresher... not a 3-hour tutorial
- I am constantly learning and relearning and having to hunt down the exact syntax for stuff

## Ideal Solution

- a format that can be quickly referenced and digested in less than a minute
- be able to house everything from syntax references to common interview questions
- streamline my daily activities and make 'ramping back up' a breeze
