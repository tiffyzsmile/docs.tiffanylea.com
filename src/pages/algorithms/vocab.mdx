## Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm’s running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases.

- This is also known as an algorithm’s growth rate
- Does the algorithm suddenly become incredibly slow when the input size grows?
- Does it mostly maintain its quick run time as the input size increases?
- Asymptotic Notation gives us the ability to answer these questions.

## Big-O

Big-O, commonly written as O, is an Asymptotic Notation for the worst case, or ceiling of growth for a given function.
