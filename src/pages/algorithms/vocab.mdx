## Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm’s running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases (aka an algorithm’s growth rate)

- Does the algorithm suddenly become incredibly slow when the input size grows?
- Does it mostly maintain its quick run time as the input size increases?

### Types of Asymptotic Notations

- [Big-O Notation](/algorithms/bigo) (O-notation): worst-case
- Omega Notation (Ω-notation): best-case
- Theta Notation (Θ-notation): average-case
