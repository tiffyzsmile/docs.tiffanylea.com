# Algorithm

## What is an Algorithm?

A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## Properties of Algorithms

1. Input - An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
2. Output - From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem.
3. Definiteness - The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.
4. Correctness - An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.
5. Finiteness - An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of steps for any input in the set.
6. Effectiveness - It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time.
7. Generality - The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a particular set of input values

## Measuring Algorithms

- Algorithm times measured in terms of growth of an algorithm
- Algorithm times written in [Big O notation](/algorithms/bigo)

## Searching Algorithms

Searching Algorithms check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

1. **Sequential Search:** In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.
2. **Interval Search:** These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.
