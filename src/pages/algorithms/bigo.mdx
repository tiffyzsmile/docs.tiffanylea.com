# Big O Notation

## What is it?

Simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency.

- We analyze time complexity for:

  - very large input size
  - worst case scenario

## Formula

```
O(n)
```

- O: represents the function or algorithm that is being evaluated
- n: represents the number of elements/input

## Order of Complexity

|     | Big O            | Description                         | What that means                                                                             |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤩  | O(1)             | Static                              | You know exactly how long it will take to run the function everytime (large or small input) |
| 😁  | O(log n)         | "divide and conquer", binary search | Break results into 2, eliminate 50% that doesn't contain item                               |
| 🙂  | O(n)             | Directly and linearly linked with N | How long it takes to run is directly based on how big N is (for loops)                      |
| 😒  | O(n log n)       | Merge search, like deck of cards    | ...                                                                                         |
| 😬  | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Checking list and grocery cart      | Doing something against 2+ variable length inputs makes it exponential                      |
| 😳  | O(infinity)      | Flipping a coin                     | There is a chance the coin may never turn up heads and would have to go on forever          |

## General Rules

1. Certain terms "dominate" others, drop lower order terms

<Code>O(1) `<` O(logn) `<` O(n) `<` O(nlogn) `<` O(n<sup>2</sup>) `<` O(2<sup>n</sup>) `<` O(n!)</Code>

2. Ignore constants

```
5n -> O(n)
```

3. Conditional Statements: Use the worst case

## Example:

<Code>
  T(n) = 17n<sup>4</sup> + 3n<sup>3</sup> + 4n + 8
</Code>

<br />
<Code>
  1. T(n) = 17n<sup>4</sup>
  <strike>
    + 3n<sup>3</sup> + 4n + 8
  </strike>
</Code>
<br />
<Code>
  why?... O(n<sup>4</sup>) dominates over O(n<sup>3</sup>) O(n) O(1)
</Code>
<br />
<Code>
  2. T(n) = <strike>17</strike>n<sup>4</sup>
</Code>
<br />
<Code>
  T(n) = O(n<sup>4</sup>)
</Code>
