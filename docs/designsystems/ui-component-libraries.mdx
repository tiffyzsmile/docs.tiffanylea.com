# UI Component Libraries

## Some reasons to go explore these:

## While developing

- Defining naming conventions or figuring out what to name your component and/or component api (prop options)
- Figuring out what are common use cases the component may need to be extended for?
- How do others scale this type of component?

## In General

- What do you like about their storybooks?
- What do you not like?

## UI Component Libraries List

### [Audi](https://react.ui.audi/)

- Custom branding
- Good nav breakdown
- Good docs around defining the design system
- Example of space handling
- Good documentation around best practices when using specific components
- Love that they have links to W3C docs: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel

### [Workday Canvas Kit](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/welcome-getting-started--page)

- **GREAT** API & Pattern Guidelines documentation, not necessarily supporting exact choices (not looking that in depth) but the style of documentation and the topics covered
- Good example of Component status documentation
- Good to have contribution guidelines
- Good grouping in nav

### [Gitlab](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-accordion--default)

- Good breakdown of navigation categories, not one big list

### [Shopify](https://5d559397bae39100201eedc1-wvrmdldybf.chromatic.com/?path=/story/playground-playground--playground)

- Notice navigation is one big list and not as easy to navigate.

### [Backpack UI](https://lonelyplanet.github.io/backpack-ui/?path=/story/styles--design-tokens)

- Notice how Styles->Icons are hard to view them all at once. If thinking about the UX this could have been organized better.

### [IBM](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview/)

- Tho it is not a storybook it is a good resource for how they categorize, document and in general handle things

### [USWDS Components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/)

- Again not a storybook but GREAT resource for generic ui components

### [WIX](https://www.wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/introduction-getting-started--getting-started)

- Notice how the colors and icons are done. Icon allows for search which is nice

### [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.netlify.app/?path=/story/accordion--default)

- Bad nav
- Good multi example views vs breaking them all up individually

### [Grommet](https://storybook.grommet.io/)

- Good Nav grouping

### [Reaviz](https://reaviz.io/?path=/story/docs-intro--page)

- Good charts examples

### [Lucid](https://appnexus.github.io/lucid/?path=/docs/documentation-introduction--introduction)

- Like how some nav goes straight to docs view vs canvas view
- Bad not good UX for documentation (TLDR) and too small and it keeps scrolling me to the bottom

### [AnyVision](http://storybook.anyvision.co/?path=/docs/content-tooltip--interactive)

- Good example of tooltip variants (overflow)

### [Backpack](https://backpack.github.io/storybook/?path=/story/bpk-animate-height--example)

- Really bad nav

### [Grafana](https://developers.grafana.com/ui/latest/index.html?path=/story/docs-overview-intro--page)

- Good nav categories
- Good multi examples per canvas
- Icons too small to see easily
- Would also prefer bigger theme color swatches and not so many colors....

### [Power Xpert Blue](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/story/intro-overview--px-blue-react-components)

- Limited but still good examples

### [Salesforce](http://design-system-react-components.herokuapp.com/?path=/story/sldsaccordion--base)

- Bad nav
