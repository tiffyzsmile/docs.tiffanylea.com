## Doctype

- It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags)
- The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not case sensitive

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> // HTML5
```

The doctype is used for two things:

- Web browsers use it to determine which rendering mode they should use
  - Valid doctype triggers “Standards Mode”
    - indicates that document is coded well
    - browsers try to render the page according to the CSS specifications
  - Outdated or incomplete doctype triggers “Quirks mode”
    - assumes that document is old, backwards compatible with old practices and old browsers
    - web page will still render, but it'll take more processing power and you’ll likely get a strange or ugly result
- Markup validators look at it to determine which rules they should check the document against
